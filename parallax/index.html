            Radha (Sanskrit: राधा, IAST: Rādhā), also called Radhika, is a Hindu
            goddess and the chief consort of the god Krishna. She is the goddess
            of love, tenderness, compassion, and devotion. In scriptures, Radha
            is mentioned as the avatar of Lakshmi[12][13] and also as the
            Mūlaprakriti, the Supreme goddess, who is the feminine counterpart
            and internal potency (hladini shakti) of Krishna.[1][14][15][16][17]
            Radha accompanies Krishna in all his incarnations.[18][19] Radha's
            birthday is celebrated every year on the occasion of
            Radhashtami.[20][21] In relation with Krishna, Radha has dual
            representation—the lover consort as well as his married consort.
            Traditions like Nimbarka Sampradaya worship Radha as the eternal
            consort and wedded wife of Krishna.[22][23][24][25] In contrast,
            traditions like Gaudiya Vaishnavism revere her as Krishna's lover
            and the divine consort.[26][24] In Radha Vallabh Sampradaya and
            Haridasi Sampradaya, only Radha is worshipped as the Supreme
            being.[27] Elsewhere, she is venerated with Krishna as his principal
            consort in Nimbarka Sampradaya, Pushtimarg, Mahanam Sampradaya,
            Swaminarayan Sampradaya, Vaishnava-Sahajiya, Manipuri Vaishnavism,
            and Gaudiya Vaishnavism movements linked to Chaitanya
            Mahaprabhu.[28] Radha (Sanskrit: राधा, IAST: Rādhā), also called

            Krishna (/ˈkrɪʃnə/;[12] Sanskrit: कृष्ण, IAST: Kṛṣṇa [ˈkr̩ʂɳɐ]) is a
            major deity in Hinduism. He is worshipped as the eighth avatar of
            Vishnu and also as the Supreme God in his own right.[13] He is the
            god of protection, compassion, tenderness, and love;[14][1] and is
            widely revered among Hindu divinities.[15] Krishna's birthday is
            celebrated every year by Hindus on Krishna Janmashtami according to
            the lunisolar Hindu calendar, which falls in late August or early
            September of the Gregorian calendar.[16][17][18] The anecdotes and
            narratives of Krishna's life are generally titled as Krishna Līlā.
            He is a central figure in the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata Purana, the
            Brahma Vaivarta Purana, and the Bhagavad Gita, and is mentioned in
            many Hindu philosophical, theological, and mythological texts.[19]
            They portray him in various perspectives: as a god-child, a
            prankster, a model lover, a divine hero, and the universal supreme
            being.[20] His iconography reflects these legends and shows him in
            different stages of his life, such as an infant eating butter, a
            young boy playing a flute, a young boy with Radha or surrounded by
            female devotees, or a friendly charioteer giving counsel to
            Arjuna.[21] The name and synonyms of Krishna have been traced to 1st
            millennium BCE literature and cults.[22] In some sub-traditions,
            like Krishnaism, Krishna is worshipped as the Supreme God and Svayam
            Bhagavan (God Himself). These sub-traditions arose in the context of
            the medieval era Bhakti movement.[23][24] Krishna-related literature
            has inspired numerous performance arts such as Bharatanatyam,
            Kathakali, Kuchipudi, Odissi, and Manipuri dance.[25][26] He is a
            pan-Hindu god, but is particularly revered in some locations, such
            as Vrindavan in Uttar Pradesh,[27] Dwarka and Junagadh in Gujarat;
            the Jagannatha aspect in Odisha, Mayapur in West Bengal;[23][28][29]
            in the form of Vithoba in Pandharpur, Maharashtra, Shrinathji at
            Nathdwara in Rajasthan,[23][30] Udupi Krishna in Karnataka,[31]
            Parthasarathy in Tamil Nadu and in Aranmula, Kerala, and
            Guruvayoorappan in Guruvayoor in Kerala.[32] Since the 1960s, the
            worship of Krishna has also spread to the Western world and to
            Africa, largely due to the work of the International Society for
            Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON).[33]

            Shiva (/ˈʃɪvə/; Sanskrit: शिव, lit. 'The Auspicious One', IAST: Śiva
            [ɕɪʋɐ]), also known as Mahadeva (/məˈhɑː ˈdeɪvə/; Sanskrit: महादेव:,
            lit. 'The Great God', IAST: Mahādevaḥ, [mɐɦaːd̪eːʋɐh)[9][10][11] is
            one of the principal deities of Hinduism.[12] He is the Supreme
            Being in Shaivism, one of the major traditions within Hinduism.[13]
            Shiva is known as The Destroyer within the Trimurti, the Hindu
            trinity which also includes Brahma and Vishnu.[2][14] In the
            Shaivite tradition, Shiva is the Supreme Lord who creates, protects
            and transforms the universe.[9][10][11] In the goddess-oriented
            Shakta tradition, the Supreme Goddess (Devi) is regarded as the
            energy and creative power (Shakti) and the equal complementary
            partner of Shiva.[15][16] Shiva is one of the five equivalent
            deities in Panchayatana puja of the Smarta tradition of
            Hinduism.[17] Shiva has many aspects, benevolent as well as
            fearsome. In benevolent aspects, he is depicted as an omniscient
            Yogi who lives an ascetic life on Mount Kailash[2] as well as a
            householder with his wife Parvati and his two children, Ganesha and
            Kartikeya. In his fierce aspects, he is often depicted slaying
            demons. Shiva is also known as Adiyogi (the first Yogi), regarded as
            the patron god of yoga, meditation and the arts.[18] The
            iconographical attributes of Shiva are the serpent king Vasuki
            around his neck, the adorning crescent moon, the holy river Ganga
            flowing from his matted hair, the third eye on his forehead (the eye
            that turns everything in front of it into ashes when opened), the
            trishula or trident as his weapon, and the damaru. He is usually
            worshipped in the aniconic form of lingam.[3] Shiva has pre-Vedic
            roots,[19] and the figure of Shiva evolved as an amalgamation of
            various older non-Vedic and Vedic deities, including the Rigvedic
            storm god Rudra who may also have non-Vedic origins,[20] into a
            single major deity.[21] Shiva is a pan-Hindu deity, revered widely
            by Hindus in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Indonesia
            (especially in Java and Bali).[22]

          <h1 class="heading">Hanuman Ji</h1>
          <p>
            Hanuman (/ˈhʌnʊˌmɑːn/; Sanskrit: हनुमान्, IAST: Hanumān),[5] also
            known as Maruti, Bajrangabali, and Anjaneya,[6] is a deity in
            Hinduism, revered as a divine vanara, and a devoted companion of the
            deity Rama. Central to the Ramayana, Hanuman is celebrated for his
            unwavering devotion to Rama and is considered a chiranjivi. He is
            traditionally believed to be the spiritual offspring of the wind
            deity Vayu, who is said to have played a significant role in his
            birth.[7][8] In Shaiva tradition, he is regarded to be an
            incarnation of Shiva, while in most of the Vaishnava traditions he
            is the son and incarnation of Vayu. His tales are recounted not only
            in the Ramayana but also in the Mahabharata and various Puranas.
            Devotional practices centered around Hanuman were not prominent in
            these texts or in early archaeological evidence. His theological
            significance and the cultivation of a devoted following emerged
            roughly a millennium after the Ramayana was composed, during the
            second millennium CE, coinciding with the advent of Islamic rule in
            the Indian subcontinent.[9] Hanuman's abilities are partly
            attributed to his lineage from Vayu, symbolizing a connection with
            both the physical and the cosmic elements.[10] Figures from the
            Bhakti movement, such as Samarth Ramdas, have portrayed Hanuman as
            an emblem of nationalism and defiance against oppression.[11]
            According to Vaishnava tradition, the sage Madhvacharya posited that
            Vayu aids Vishnu in his earthly incarnations, a role akin to
            Hanuman's assistance to Rama.[12] In recent times, the veneration of
            Hanuman through iconography and temple worship has significantly
            increased.[13] He epitomizes the fusion of "strength, heroic
            initiative, and assertive excellence" with "loving, emotional
            devotion" to his lord Rama, embodying both Shakti and Bhakti.[14]
            Subsequent literature has occasionally depicted him as the patron
            deity of martial arts, meditation, and scholarly pursuits.[15] He is
            revered as an exemplar of self-control, faith, and commitment to a
            cause, transcending his outward Vanara appearance.[13][16][17]
            Traditionally, Hanuman is celebrated as a lifelong celibate,
            embodying the virtues of chastity.[13][18] Various scholars have
            suggested that Hanuman may have influenced the conception of Sun
            Wukong, the central figure in the Chinese epic Journey to the
            West.[19][20]
